# Algorithms_2_Princeton_Assignment_2
read the instructions in the html pages "Programming Assignment .......html". needs to add course library algs4.jar to properly run (found in the root folder)

The assignment consists only of SeamCarving.java. All the other classes were provided by the course to test the functionality.
seam-testing.zip is also provided by the course as inputs for the test

The image file that Picture.java takes as constructor needs to be in the root folder when run on Eclipse.
If run on the commandline, the file needs to be inside the src folder (the same of the java class)

To run this program in the command line using javac-algs4 and java-algs4, you can go back to the instructions
of the very first assignment in Module I.
